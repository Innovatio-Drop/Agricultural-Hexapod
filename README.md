# Agricultural-Hexapod
Robotic Design in the field of agriculture and irrigation.
It is a mechanical vehicle that walks on six legs. Our Product is biologically inspired by Hexapod locomotion. It is built with 18 DOF(degrees of freedom) which can walk on all the terrains. It has a specification of measuring humidity levels of soils using its humidity sensor and in turn reporting the user. Depending on the soil moisture in the field, water pump will automatically start and supply the water into  the field. It has a high power supply through a LiPo ateery which also gives light intensity.
The main aim of the project is to aid farmers to monitor the status of the crops and to analyze the soil.
